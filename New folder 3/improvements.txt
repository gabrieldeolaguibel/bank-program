0. Made it so that the program works on a username base, instead of ID, since all of them are unique (per the requirements)
1. Added functionality to delete/add/view blacklist (based on username)
2. Added function to see balance of branch (admin only)
3. Blacklist array is loaded automatically into a file (branch name + BL.txt), and retrieved from there
4. Combined withdraw and deposit into a single function
5. Re-organized main so that it is easier to follow

We have a placeholder user on all the files, since for some reason, the first user always had an incorrect balance
